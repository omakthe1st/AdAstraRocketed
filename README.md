# AdAstraRocketed
## BUT IN THIS FORK I:
have no idea how to code and winging the recipe additions!!   
have no idea how to build and am pressing every button infront of me like a monkey!!!   
## you have been warned
these fixes are terrible and i made them as a little band aid for my modpack, i will release it cause why not.
# I DID IT
ignore the hello-s, I managed to do it after banging my head against a wall for 3 hours, I also learnt a great deal of stuff!
# THIS WAS FOR PERSONAL USE
ignore it please, *especially the owner please thank*, i made it cause i cant wait for mod updates and thought it'd be a good way to learn how github works. I have now used it and wont touch it again. goodbye!
